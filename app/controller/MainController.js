The day is approaching when it  will have yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the  loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The time is approaching when every created thing will have cast  its burden.  Glorified be God Who hath vouchsafed this grace that  encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen!”</q>  <q class="baha">“These great  oppressions,”</q> He, moreover, foreshadowing humanity’s golden age, has  written, <q class="baha">“are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great Justice.”</q>  This  Most Great Justice is indeed the Justice upon which the structure of the  Most Great Peace can alone, and must eventually, rest, while the Most  Great Peace will, in turn, usher in that Most Great, that World Civilization  <span data-pg="6"></span>  which shall remain forever associated with Him Who beareth the  Most Great Name.</p><h3 class="subhead" data-title="Tribulations of the Faith"></h3><p id="9">  Beloved friends!  Well nigh a hundred years have elapsed since the  Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh dawned upon the world — a Revelation, the  nature of which, as affirmed by Himself, <q class="baha">“none among the Manifestations  of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely  apprehended.”</q>  For a whole century God has respited mankind, that it  might acknowledge the Founder of such a Revelation, espouse His  Cause, proclaim His greatness, and establish His Order.  In a hundred  volumes, the repositories of priceless precepts, mighty laws, unique  principles, impassioned exhortations, reiterated warnings, amazing  prophecies, sublime invocations, and weighty commentaries, the  Bearer of such a Message has proclaimed, as no Prophet before Him has  done, the Mission with which God had entrusted Him.  To emperors,  kings, princes and potentates, to rulers, governments, clergy and peoples,  whether of the East or of the West, whether Christian, Jew,  Muslim, or Zoroastrian, He addressed, for well-nigh fifty years, and in  the most tragic circumstances, these priceless pearls of knowledge and  wisdom that lay hid within the ocean of His matchless utterance.  Forsaking fame and fortune, accepting imprisonment and exile, careless  of ostracism and obloquy, submitting to physical indignities and  cruel deprivations, He, the Vicegerent of God on earth, suffered Himself  to be banished from place to place and from country to country, till  at length He, in the Most Great Prison, offered up His martyred son as a  ransom for the redemption and unification of all mankind.  <q class="baha">“We verily,”</q>  He Himself has testified, <q class="baha">“have not fallen short of Our duty to exhort  men, and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God, the Almighty,  the All-Praised.  Had they hearkened unto Me, they would have beheld  the earth another earth.”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“Is there any excuse left for anyone  in this Revelation?  No, by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne!  My signs  have encompassed the earth, and My power enveloped all mankind, and  yet the people are wrapped in a strange sleep!”</q></p><p id="10">  How — we may well ask ourselves — has the world, the object of such  Divine solicitude, repaid Him Who sacrificed His all for its sake?  What  <span data-pg="7"></span>  manner of welcome did it accord Him, and what response did His call  evoke?  A clamor, unparalleled in the history of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Islám, greeted, in  the land of its birth, the infant light of the Faith, in the midst of a people  notorious for its crass ignorance, its fierce fanaticism, its barbaric  cruelty, its ingrained prejudices, and the unlimited sway held over the  masses by a firmly entrenched ecclesiastical hierarchy.  A persecution,  kindling a courage which, as attested by no less eminent an authority  than the late Lord Curzon of Kedleston, has been unsurpassed by that  which the fires of Smithfield evoked, mowed down, with tragic swiftness,  no less than twenty thousand of its heroic adherents, who refused  to barter their newly born faith for the fleeting honors and security of a  mortal life.</p><p id="11">  To the bodily agonies inflicted upon these sufferers, the charges, so  unmerited, of Nihilism, occultism, anarchism, eclecticism, immorality,  sectarianism, heresy, political partisanship — each conclusively disproved  by the tenets of the Faith itself and by the conduct of its  followers — were added, swelling thereby the number of those who,  unwittingly or maliciously, were injuring its cause.</p><p id="12"> Unmitigated indifference on the part of men of eminence and rank;  unrelenting hatred shown by the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the Faith  from which it had sprung; the scornful derision of the people among  whom it was born; the utter contempt which most of those kings and  rulers who had been addressed by its Author manifested towards it; the  condemnations pronounced, the threats hurled, and the banishments  decreed by those under whose sway it arose and first spread; the distortion  to which its principles and laws were subjected by the envious and  the malicious, in lands and among peoples far beyond the country of its  origin — all these are but the evidences of the treatment meted out by a  generation sunk in self-content, careless of its God, and oblivious of the  omens, prophecies, warnings and admonitions revealed by His Messengers.</p><p id="13">  The blows so heavily dealt the followers of so precious, so glorious, so  potent a Faith failed, however, to assuage the animosity that inflamed its  persecutors.  Nor did the deliberate and mischievous misrepresentations  of its fundamental teachings, its aims and purposes, its hopes and  aspirations, its institutions and activities, suffice to stay the hand of the  oppressor and the calumniator, who sought by every means in their  power to abolish its name and extirpate its system.  The hand which had  <span data-pg="8"></span>  struck down so vast a number of its blameless and humble lovers and  servants was now raised to deal its Founders the heaviest and cruelest  blows.</p></div>');
