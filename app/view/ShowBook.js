Its   driving power is remorselessly gaining in range and momentum.  Its   cleansing force, however much undetected, is increasing with every   passing day.  Humanity, gripped in the clutches of its devastating power,   is smitten by the evidences of its resistless fury.  It can neither perceive   its origin, nor probe its significance, nor discern its outcome.  Bewildered,   agonized and helpless, it watches this great and mighty wind of God   invading the remotest and fairest regions of the earth, rocking its   foundations, deranging its equilibrium, sundering its nations, disrupting the   homes of its peoples, wasting its cities, driving into exile its kings,   pulling down its bulwarks, uprooting its institutions, dimming its light,   and harrowing up the souls of its inhabitants.   </p><p id="3">        <q class="baha">“The time for the destruction of the world and   its people,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh’s    prophetic pen has proclaimed, <q class="baha">hath arrived.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The hour    is approaching,”</q>   He specifically affirms, <q class="baha">“when the most great convulsion    will   have appeared.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The promised day is come, the day when   tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath your    feet,   saying:  ‘Taste ye what your hands have wrought!’”</q>  <q class="baha">“Soon   shall the    blasts of His chastisement beat upon you, and the dust of hell   enshroud    you.”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“And when the appointed hour is   come, there shall    suddenly appear that which shall cause the limbs of mankind   to quake.”</q>     <q class="baha">“The day is approaching when its <span class="ed_note">[civilization’s]</span> flame will devour the    cities, when   the Tongue of Grandeur will proclaim:  ‘The Kingdom is    God’s, the Almighty,   the All-Praised!’”</q>  <q class="baha">“The day will soon come,”</q> He,   referring to the foolish ones of the earth, has written, <q class="baha">“whereon   they will    cry out for help and receive no answer.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The   day is approaching,”</q> He    moreover has prophesied, <q class="baha">“when the   wrathful anger of the Almighty will    have taken hold of them.  He, verily, is   the Omnipotent, the All-Subduing,    the Most Powerful.  He shall cleanse the   earth from the     <span data-pg="4"></span>   defilement of their corruption,   and shall give it for an heritage unto such    of His servants as are nigh unto   Him.”</q>   </p><p id="4">     <q class="bab">“As to those who deny Him Who is the Sublime Gate of God,”</q> the Báb,   for His part, has affirmed in the <span class="doc">Qayyúm-i-Asmá’</span>, <q class="bab">“for them We have   prepared, as justly decreed by God, a sore torment.  And He, God, is the   Mighty, the Wise.”</q>  And further, <q class="bab">“O peoples of the earth!  I swear by your   Lord!  Ye shall act as former generations have acted.  Warn ye, then,   yourselves of the terrible, the most grievous vengeance of God.  For God is,   verily, potent over all things.”</q>  And again:  <q class="bab">“By My glory!  I will make the   infidels to taste, with the hands of My power, retributions unknown of   anyone except Me, and will waft over the faithful those musk-scented   breaths which I have nursed in the midmost heart of My throne.”</q>   </p><p id="5">     Dear friends!  The powerful operations of this titanic upheaval are   comprehensible to none except such as have recognized the claims of   both Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb.  Their followers know full well whence it   comes, and what it will ultimately lead to.  Though ignorant of how far it   will reach, they clearly recognize its genesis, are aware of its direction,   acknowledge its necessity, observe confidently its mysterious processes,   ardently pray for the mitigation of its severity, intelligently labor to   assuage its fury, and anticipate, with undimmed vision, the consummation   of the fears and the hopes it must necessarily engender.    </p><p id="6">     This judgment of God, as viewed by those who have recognized   Bahá’u’lláh as His Mouthpiece and His greatest Messenger on earth, is   both a retributory calamity and an act of holy and supreme discipline.  It   is at once a visitation from God and a cleansing process for all mankind.   Its fires punish the perversity of the human race, and weld its component   parts into one organic, indivisible, world-embracing community.  Mankind,   in these fateful years, which at once signalize the passing of the   first century of the Bahá’í Era and proclaim the opening of a new one, is,   as ordained by Him Who is both the Judge and the Redeemer of the   human race, being simultaneously called upon to give account of its   past actions, and is being purged and prepared for its future mission.  It   can neither escape the responsibilities of the past, nor shirk those of the   future.  God, the Vigilant, the Just, the Loving, the All-Wise Ordainer,   <span data-pg="5"></span>   can, in this supreme Dispensation, neither allow the sins of an unregenerate   humanity, whether of omission or of commission, to go unpunished,   nor will He be willing to abandon His children to their fate,   and refuse them that culminating and blissful stage in their long, their   slow and painful evolution throughout the ages, which is at once their   inalienable right and their true destiny.   </p><p id="7">     <q class="baha">“Bestir yourselves, O people,”</q> is, on the one hand, the ominous   warning sounded by Bahá’u’lláh Himself, <q class="baha">“in anticipation of the days of   Divine Justice, for the promised hour is now come.”</q>  <q class="baha">“Abandon that   which ye possess, and seize that which God, Who layeth low the necks of   men, hath brought.  Know ye of a certainty that if ye turn not back from   that which ye have committed, chastisement will overtake you on every   side, and ye shall behold things more grievous than that which ye beheld   aforetime.”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“We have fixed a time for you, O people!  If ye fail,   at the appointed hour, to turn towards God, He, verily, will lay violent   hold on you, and will cause grievous afflictions to assail you from every   direction.  How severe indeed is the chastisement with which your Lord   will then chastise you!”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“God assuredly dominateth the lives   of them that wronged Us, and is well aware of their doings.  He will most   certainly lay hold on them for their sins.  He, verily, is the fiercest of   Avengers.”</q>  And finally:  <q class="baha">“O ye peoples of the world!  Know verily that an   unforeseen calamity is following you and that grievous retribution   awaiteth you.  Think not the deeds ye have committed have been blotted   from My sight.  By My Beauty!  All your doings hath My pen graven with   open characters upon tablets of chrysolite.”</q>   </p><p id="8">     <q class="baha">“The whole earth,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh, on the other hand, forecasting the   bright future in store for a world now wrapt in darkness, emphatically   asserts, <q class="baha">“is now in a state of pregnancy.  The day is approaching when it   will have yielded its noblest fruits, when from it will have sprung forth the   loftiest trees, the most enchanting blossoms, the most heavenly blessings.”</q>   <q class="baha">“The time is approaching when every created thing will have cast   its burden.  Glorified be God Who hath vouchsafed this grace that   encompasseth all things, whether seen or unseen!”</q>  <q class="baha">“These great   oppressions,”</q> He, moreover, foreshadowing humanity’s golden age, has   written, <q class="baha">“are preparing it for the advent of the Most Great Justice.”</q>  This   Most Great Justice is indeed the Justice upon which the structure of the   Most Great Peace can alone, and must eventually, rest, while the Most   Great Peace will, in turn, usher in that Most Great, that World Civilization   <span data-pg="6"></span>   which shall remain forever associated with Him Who beareth the   Most Great Name.   </p><h3 class="subhead" data-title="Tribulations of the Faith"></h3>  <p id="9">   Beloved friends!  Well nigh a hundred years have elapsed since the   Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh dawned upon the world — a Revelation, the   nature of which, as affirmed by Himself, <q class="baha">“none among the Manifestations   of old, except to a prescribed degree, hath ever completely   apprehended.”</q>  For a whole century God has respited mankind, that it   might acknowledge the Founder of such a Revelation, espouse His   Cause, proclaim His greatness, and establish His Order.  In a hundred   volumes, the repositories of priceless precepts, mighty laws, unique   principles, impassioned exhortations, reiterated warnings, amazing   prophecies, sublime invocations, and weighty commentaries, the   Bearer of such a Message has proclaimed, as no Prophet before Him has   done, the Mission with which God had entrusted Him.  To emperors,   kings, princes and potentates, to rulers, governments, clergy and peoples,   whether of the East or of the West, whether Christian, Jew,   Muslim, or Zoroastrian, He addressed, for well-nigh fifty years, and in   the most tragic circumstances, these priceless pearls of knowledge and   wisdom that lay hid within the ocean of His matchless utterance.   Forsaking fame and fortune, accepting imprisonment and exile, careless   of ostracism and obloquy, submitting to physical indignities and   cruel deprivations, He, the Vicegerent of God on earth, suffered Himself   to be banished from place to place and from country to country, till   at length He, in the Most Great Prison, offered up His martyred son as a   ransom for the redemption and unification of all mankind.  <q class="baha">“We verily,”</q>   He Himself has testified, <q class="baha">“have not fallen short of Our duty to exhort   men, and to deliver that whereunto I was bidden by God, the Almighty,   the All-Praised.  Had they hearkened unto Me, they would have beheld   the earth another earth.”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“Is there any excuse left for anyone   in this Revelation?  No, by God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne!  My signs   have encompassed the earth, and My power enveloped all mankind, and   yet the people are wrapped in a strange sleep!”</q>   </p><p id="10">   How — we may well ask ourselves — has the world, the object of such   Divine solicitude, repaid Him Who sacrificed His all for its sake?  What   <span data-pg="7"></span>   manner of welcome did it accord Him, and what response did His call   evoke?  A clamor, unparalleled in the history of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Islám, greeted, in   the land of its birth, the infant light of the Faith, in the midst of a people   notorious for its crass ignorance, its fierce fanaticism, its barbaric   cruelty, its ingrained prejudices, and the unlimited sway held over the   masses by a firmly entrenched ecclesiastical hierarchy.  A persecution,   kindling a courage which, as attested by no less eminent an authority   than the late Lord Curzon of Kedleston, has been unsurpassed by that   which the fires of Smithfield evoked, mowed down, with tragic swiftness,   no less than twenty thousand of its heroic adherents, who refused   to barter their newly born faith for the fleeting honors and security of a   mortal life.   </p><p id="11">   To the bodily agonies inflicted upon these sufferers, the charges, so   unmerited, of Nihilism, occultism, anarchism, eclecticism, immorality,   sectarianism, heresy, political partisanship — each conclusively disproved   by the tenets of the Faith itself and by the conduct of its   followers — were added, swelling thereby the number of those who,   unwittingly or maliciously, were injuring its cause.   </p><p id="12">   Unmitigated indifference on the part of men of eminence and rank;   unrelenting hatred shown by the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the Faith   from which it had sprung; the scornful derision of the people among   whom it was born; the utter contempt which most of those kings and   rulers who had been addressed by its Author manifested towards it; the   condemnations pronounced, the threats hurled, and the banishments   decreed by those under whose sway it arose and first spread; the distortion   to which its principles and laws were subjected by the envious and   the malicious, in lands and among peoples far beyond the country of its   origin — all these are but the evidences of the treatment meted out by a   generation sunk in self-content, careless of its God, and oblivious of the   omens, prophecies, warnings and admonitions revealed by His Messengers.   </p><p id="13">   The blows so heavily dealt the followers of so precious, so glorious, so   potent a Faith failed, however, to assuage the animosity that inflamed its   persecutors.  Nor did the deliberate and mischievous misrepresentations   of its fundamental teachings, its aims and purposes, its hopes and   aspirations, its institutions and activities, suffice to stay the hand of the   oppressor and the calumniator, who sought by every means in their   power to abolish its name and extirpate its system.  The hand which had   <span data-pg="8"></span>   struck down so vast a number of its blameless and humble lovers and   servants was now raised to deal its Founders the heaviest and cruelest   blows.   </p><p id="14">   The Báb — <q class="baha">“the Point,”</q> as affirmed by Bahá’u’lláh,   <q class="baha">“round Whom the   realities of the Prophets and Messengers revolve”</q> — was the One first   swept into the maelstrom which engulfed His supporters.  Sudden arrest   and confinement in the very first year of His short and spectacular   career; public affront deliberately inflicted in the presence of the   ecclesiastical dignitaries of <u>Sh</u>íráz; strict and prolonged incarceration in   the bleak fastnesses of the mountains of Á<u>dh</u>irbayján; a contemptuous   disregard and a cowardly jealousy evinced respectively by the Chief   Magistrate of the realm and the foremost minister of his government; the   carefully staged and farcical interrogatory sustained in the presence of   the heir to the Throne and the distinguished divines of Tabríz; the   shameful infliction of the bastinado in the prayer house, and at the   hands of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám of that city; and finally suspension in the   barrack-square of Tabríz and the discharge of a volley of above seven   hundred bullets at His youthful breast under the eyes of a callous   multitude of about ten thousand people, culminating in the ignominious   exposure of His mangled remains on the edge of the moat without   the city gate — these were the progressive stages in the tumultuous and   tragic ministry of One Whose age inaugurated the consummation of all   ages, and Whose Revelation fulfilled the promise of all Revelations.   </p><p id="15">     <q class="bab">“I swear by God!”</q> the Báb Himself in His Tablet to Mu?ammad <u>Sh</u>áh   has written, <q class="bab">“Shouldst thou know the things which in the space of these   four years have befallen Me at the hands of thy people and thine army,   thou wouldst hold thy breath from fear of God....  Alas, alas, for the   things which have touched Me!...  I swear by the Most Great Lord!  Wert   thou to be told in what place I dwell, the first person to have mercy on Me   would be thyself.  In the heart of a mountain is a fortress <span class="ed_note">[Mákú]</span> ... the   inmates of which are confined to two guards and four dogs.  Picture, then,   My plight....  In this mountain I have remained alone, and have come   to such a pass that none of those gone before Me have suffered what I have   suffered, nor any transgressor endured what I have endured!”</q>   </p><p id="16">     <q class="bab">“How veiled are ye, O My creatures,”</q> He, speaking with the voice of   God, has revealed in the Bayán, <q class="bab">“...who, without any right, have   consigned Him unto a mountain <span class="ed_note">[Mákú]</span>, not one of whose inhabitants is   worthy of mention....  With Him, which is with Me, there is no one   <span data-pg="9"></span>   except him who is one of the Letters of the Living of My Book.  In His   presence, which is My Presence, there is not at night even a lighted lamp!   And yet, in places <span class="ed_note">[of worship]</span> which in varying degrees reach out unto   Him, unnumbered lamps are shining!  All that is on earth hath been   created for Him, and all partake with delight of His benefits, and yet they   are so veiled from Him as to refuse Him even a lamp!”</q>   </p><p id="17">   What of Bahá’u’lláh, the germ of Whose Revelation, as attested by   the Báb, is endowed with a potency superior to the combined forces of   the Bábí Dispensation?  Was He not — He for Whom the Báb had   suffered and died in such tragic and miraculous circumstances — made,   for nearly half a century and under the domination of the two most   powerful potentates of the East, the object of a systematic and concerted   conspiracy which, in its effects and duration, is scarcely paralleled in the   annals of previous religions?   </p><p id="18">     <q class="baha">“The cruelties inflicted by My oppressors,”</q> He Himself in His anguish   has cried out, <q class="baha">“have bowed Me down, and turned My hair white.   Shouldst thou present thyself before My throne, thou wouldst fail to   recognize the Ancient Beauty, for the freshness of His countenance is   altered and its brightness hath faded, by reason of the oppression of the   infidels.  I swear by God!  His heart, His soul, and His vitals are melted!”</q>   <q class="baha">“Wert thou to hear with Mine ear,”</q> He also declares, <q class="baha">“thou wouldst hear   how ‘Alí <span class="ed_note">[the Báb]</span> bewaileth Me in the presence of the Glorious Companion,   and how Mu?ammad weepeth over Me in the all-highest Horizon,   and how the Spirit <span class="ed_note">[Jesus]</span> beateth Himself upon the head in the   heaven of My decree, by reason of what hath befallen this Wronged One   at the hands of every impious sinner.”</q>  <q class="baha">“Before Me,”</q> He elsewhere has   written, <q class="baha">“riseth up the Serpent of wrath with jaws stretched to engulf Me,   and behind Me stalketh the lion of anger intent on tearing Me in pieces,   and above Me, O My Well-Beloved, are the clouds of Thy decree, raining   upon Me the showers of tribulations, whilst beneath Me are fixed the   spears of misfortune, ready to wound My limbs and My body.”</q>  <q class="baha">“Couldst   thou be told,”</q> He further affirms, <q class="baha">“what hath befallen the Ancient   Beauty, thou wouldst flee into the wilderness, and weep with a great   weeping.  In thy grief, thou wouldst smite thyself on the head, and cry out   as one stung by the sting of the adder....  By the righteousness of God!   Every morning I arose from My bed I discovered the hosts of countless   afflictions massed behind My door, and every night when I lay down, lo!   My heart was torn with agony at what it had suffered from the fiendish   <span data-pg="10"></span>   cruelty of its foes.  With every piece of bread the Ancient Beauty breaketh   is coupled the assault of a fresh affliction, and with every drop He   drinketh is mixed the bitterness of the most woeful of trials.  He is preceded   in every step He taketh by an army of unforeseen calamities, while in His   rear follow legions of agonizing sorrows.”</q>   </p><p id="19">   Was it not He Who, at the early age of twenty-seven, spontaneously   arose to champion, in the capacity of a mere follower, the nascent   Cause of the Báb?  Was He not the One Who by assuming the actual   leadership of a proscribed and harrassed sect exposed Himself, and His   kindred, and His possessions, and His rank, and His reputation to the   grave perils, the bloody assaults, the general spoliation and furious   defamations of both government and people?  Was it not He — the Bearer   of a Revelation, Whose day <q class="baha">“every Prophet hath announced,”</q> for which   <q class="baha">“the soul of every Divine Messenger hath thirsted,”</q> and in which <q class="baha">“God hath proved the hearts of the entire company of His Messengers and   Prophets”</q> — was not the Bearer of such a Revelation, at the instigation of   <u>Sh</u>í‘ih ecclesiastics and by order of the <u>Sh</u>áh himself forced, for no less   than four months, to breathe, in utter darkness, whilst in the company   of the vilest criminals and freighted down with galling chains, the   pestilential air of the vermin-infested subterranean dungeon of   ?ihrán — a place which, as He Himself subsequently declared, was   mysteriously converted into the very scene of the annunciation made to   Him by God of His Prophethood?   </p><p id="20">   <q class="baha">“We were consigned,”</q> He wrote in His <span class="doc">Epistle to the Son of the   Wolf</span>, <q class="baha">“for four months to a place foul beyond comparison.  As to the   dungeon in which this Wronged One and others similarly wronged were   confined, a dark and narrow pit were preferable....  The dungeon was   wrapped in thick darkness, and Our fellow prisoners numbered nearly a   hundred and fifty souls:  thieves, assassins, and highwaymen.  Though   crowded, it had no other outlet than the passage by which We entered.  No   pen can depict that place, nor any tongue describe its loathsome smell.   Most of these men had neither clothes nor bedding to lie on.  God alone   knoweth what befell Us in that most foul-smelling and gloomy place!”</q>   <q>“‘Abdu’l-Bahá,”</q> writes Dr. J.E. Esslemont, <q>“tells how one day He was   allowed to enter the prison-yard to see His beloved Father when He   came out for His daily exercise.  Bahá’u’lláh was terribly altered, so ill He   could hardly walk.  His hair and beard unkempt, His neck galled and   swollen from the pressure of a heavy steel collar, His body bent by the   <span data-pg="11"></span>   weight of His chains.”</q>  <q>“For three days and three nights,”</q> Nabíl has   recorded in his chronicle, <q>“no manner of food or drink was given to   Bahá’u’lláh.  Rest and sleep were both impossible to Him.  The place was   infested with vermin, and the stench of that gloomy abode was enough   to crush the very spirits of those who were condemned to suffer its   horrors.”</q>  <q>“Such was the intensity of His suffering that the marks of that   cruelty remained imprinted upon His body all the days of His life.”</q>   </p><p id="21">   And what of the other tribulations which, before and immediately   after this dreadful episode, touched Him?  What of His confinement in   the home of one of the kad-<u>kh</u>udás of ?ihrán?  What of the savage   violence with which He was stoned by the angry people in the neighborhood   of the village of Níyálá?  What of His incarceration by the emissaries   of the army of the <u>Sh</u>áh in Mázindarán, and His receiving the   bastinado by order, and in the presence, of the assembled siyyids and   mujtahids into whose hands He had been delivered by the civil authorities   of Ámul?  What of the howls of derision and abuse with which a   crowd of ruffians subsequently pursued Him?  What of the monstrous   accusation brought against Him by the Imperial household, the Court   and the people, when the attempt was made on the life of Ná?iri’d-Dín   <u>Sh</u>áh?  What of the infamous outrages, the abuse and ridicule heaped on   Him when He was arrested by responsible officers of the government,   and conducted from Níyávarán <q class="baha">“on foot and in chains, with bared head   and bare feet,”</q> and exposed to the fierce rays of the midsummer sun, to   the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of ?ihrán?  What of the avidity with which corrupt   officials sacked His house and carried away all His possessions and   disposed of His fortune?  What of the cruel edict that tore Him from the   small band of the Báb’s bewildered, hounded, and shepherdless followers,   separated Him from His kinsmen and friends, and banished Him,   in the depth of winter, despoiled and defamed, to Iráq?   </p><p id="22">   Severe as were these tribulations which succeeded one another with   bewildering rapidity as a result of the premeditated attacks and the   systematic machinations of the court, the clergy, the government and   the people, they were but the prelude to a harrowing and extensive   captivity which that edict had formally initiated.  Extending over a   period of more than forty years, and carrying Him successively to Iráq,   Sulaymáníyyih, Constantinople, Adrianople and finally to the penal   colony of ‘Akká, this long banishment was at last ended by His death, at   the age of over three score years and ten, terminating a captivity which,   <span data-pg="12"></span>   in its range, its duration and the diversity and severity of its afflictions,   is unexampled in the history of previous Dispensations.   </p><p id="23">   No need to expatiate on the particular episodes which cast a lurid light   on the moving annals of those years.  No need to dwell on the character   and actions of the peoples, rulers and divines who have participated in,   and contributed to heighten the poignancy of the scenes of this, the   greatest drama in the world’s spiritual history.    </p><p id="24">   To enumerate a few of the outstanding features of this moving drama   will suffice to evoke in the reader of these pages, already familiar with   the history of the Faith, the memory of those vicissitudes which it has   experienced, and which the world has until now viewed with such frigid   indifference.  The forced and sudden retirement of Bahá’u’lláh to the   mountains of Sulaymáníyyih, and the distressing consequences that   flowed from His two years’ complete withdrawal; the incessant intrigues   indulged in by the exponents of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Islám in Najaf and Karbilá,   working in close and constant association with their confederates in   Persia; the intensification of the repressive measures decreed by Sul?án   ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz which brought to a head the defection of certain prominent   members of the exiled community; the enforcement of yet another   banishment by order of that same Sul?án, this time to that far off and   most desolate of cities, causing such despair as to lead two of the exiles to   attempt suicide; the unrelaxing surveillance to which they were subjected   upon their arrival in ‘Akká, by hostile officials, and the insufferable   imprisonment for two years in the barracks of that town; the   interrogatory to which the Turkish pá<u>sh</u>á subsequently subjected his   Prisoner at the headquarters of the government; His confinement for no   less than eight years in a humble dwelling surrounded by the befouled   air of that city, His sole recreation being confined to pacing the narrow   space of His room — these, as well as other tribulations, proclaim, on the   one hand, the nature of the ordeal and the indignities He suffered, and   point, on the other, the finger of accusation at those mighty ones of the   earth who had either so sorely maltreated Him, or deliberately withheld   from Him their succor.   <span data-pg="13"></span>   </p><p id="25">   No wonder that from the Pen of Him Who bore this anguish with   such sublime patience these words should have been revealed:  <q class="baha">“He Who   is the Lord of the seen and unseen is now manifest unto all men.  His   blessed Self hath been afflicted with such harm that if all the seas, visible   and invisible, were turned into ink, and all that dwell in the kingdom   into pens, and all that are in the heavens and all that are on earth into   scribes, they would, of a certainty, be powerless to record it.”</q>  And again:   <q class="baha">“I have been, most of the days of My life, even as a slave, sitting under a   sword hanging on a thread, knowing not whether it would fall soon or   late upon him.”</q>  <q class="baha">“All this generation,”</q> He affirms, <q class="baha">“could offer Us were   wounds from its darts, and the only cup it proffered to Our lips was the   cup of its venom.  On Our neck We still bear the scar of chains, and upon   Our body are imprinted the evidences of an unyielding cruelty.”</q>  <q class="baha">“Twenty   years have passed, O kings!”</q> He, addressing the kings of Christendom, at   the height of His mission, has written, <q class="baha">“during which We have, each   day, tasted the agony of a fresh tribulation.  No one of them that were   before Us hath endured the things We have endured.  Would that ye could   perceive it!  They that rose up against Us have put Us to death, have shed   Our blood, have plundered Our property, and violated Our honor.   Though aware of most of Our afflictions, ye, nevertheless, have failed to   stay the hand of the aggressor.  For is it not your clear duty to restrain the   tyranny of the oppressor, and to deal equitably with your subjects, that   your high sense of justice may be fully demonstrated to all mankind?”</q>   </p><p id="26">   Who is the ruler, may it not be confidently asked, whether of the East   or of the West, who, at any time since the dawn of so transcendent a   Revelation, has been prompted to raise his voice either in its praise or   against those who persecuted it?  Which people has, in the course of so   long a captivity, felt urged to arise and stem the tide of such tribulations?   Who is the sovereign, excepting a single woman, shining in solitary   glory, who has, in however small a measure, felt impelled to respond to   the poignant call of Bahá’u’lláh?  Who amongst the great ones of the   earth was inclined to extend this infant Faith of God the benefit of his   recognition or support?  Which one of the multitudes of creeds, sects,   races, parties and classes and of the highly diversified schools of human   thought, considered it necessary to direct its gaze towards the rising light   of the Faith, to contemplate its unfolding system, to ponder its hidden   processes, to appraise its weighty message, to acknowledge its regenerative   <span data-pg="14"></span>   power, to embrace its salutary truth, or to proclaim its eternal   verities?  Who among the worldly wise and the so-called men of insight   and wisdom can justly claim, after the lapse of nearly a century, to have   disinterestedly approached its theme, to have considered impartially its   claims, to have taken sufficient pains to delve into its literature, to have   assiduously striven to separate facts from fiction, or to have accorded its   cause the treatment it merits?  Where are the preeminent exponents,   whether of the arts or sciences, with the exception of a few isolated cases,   who have lifted a finger, or whispered a word of commendation, in   either the defense or the praise of a Faith that has conferred upon the   world so priceless a benefit, that has suffered so long and so grievously,   and which enshrines within its shell so enthralling a promise for a world   so woefully battered, so manifestly bankrupt?   </p><p id="27">   To the mounting tide of trials which laid low the Báb, to the   long-drawn-out calamities which rained on Bahá’u’lláh, to the warnings   sounded by both the Herald and the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation,   must be added the sufferings which, for no less than seventy years, were   endured by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as well as His pleas, and entreaties, uttered in   the evening of His life, in connection with the dangers that increasingly   threatened the whole of mankind.  Born in the very year that witnessed   the inception of the Bábí Revelation; baptized with the initial fires of   persecution that raged around that nascent Cause; an eyewitness, when   a boy of eight, of the violent upheavals that rocked the Faith which His   Father had espoused; sharing with Him, the ignominy, the perils, and   rigors consequent upon the successive banishments from His native-land   to countries far beyond its confines; arrested and forced to support,   in a dark cell, the indignity of imprisonment soon after His arrival in   ‘Akká; the object of repeated investigations and the target of continual   assaults and insults under the despotic rule of Sul?án ‘Abdu’l-?amíd,   and later under the ruthless military dictatorship of the suspicious and   merciless Jamál Pá<u>sh</u>á — He, too, the Center and Pivot of Bahá’u’lláh’s   peerless Covenant and the perfect Exemplar of His teachings, was made   to taste, at the hands of potentates, ecclesiastics, governments and   peoples, the cup of woe which the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, as well as so   many of their followers, had drained.   </p><p id="28">   With the warnings which both His pen and voice have given in   countless Tablets and discourses, during an almost lifelong incarceration   and in the course of His extended travels in both the European and   <span data-pg="15"></span>   American continents, they who labor for the spread of His Father’s   Faith in the Western world are sufficiently acquainted.  How often and   how passionately did He appeal to those in authority and to the public at   large to examine dispassionately the precepts enunciated by His Father?   With what precision and emphasis He unfolded the system of the Faith   He was expounding, elucidated its fundamental verities, stressed its   distinguishing features, and proclaimed the redemptive character of its   principles?  How insistently did He foreshadow the impending chaos,   the approaching upheavals, the universal conflagration which, in the   concluding years of His life, had only begun to reveal the measure of   its force and the significance of its impact on human society?   </p><p id="29">   A co-sharer in the woeful trials and momentary frustrations afflicting   the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh; reaping a harvest in His lifetime wholly   incommensurate to the sublime, the incessant and strenuous efforts He   had exerted; experiencing the initial perturbations of the world-shaking   catastrophe in store for an unbelieving humanity; bent with age, and   with eyes dimmed by the gathering storm which the reception accorded   by a faithless generation to His Father’s Cause was raising, and with a   heart bleeding over the immediate destiny of God’s wayward children — He,   at last, sank beneath a weight of troubles for which they   who had imposed them upon Him, and upon those gone before   Him, were soon to be summoned to a dire reckoning.   </p><p id="30">     <q class="baha">“Hasten, O my God!”</q> He cried, at a time when adversity had sore   beset Him, <q class="baha">“the days of my ascension unto Thee, and of my coming   before Thee, and of my entry into Thy presence, that I may be delivered   from the darkness of the cruelty inflicted by them upon me, and may enter   the luminous atmosphere of Thy nearness, O my Lord, the All-Glorious,   and may rest under the shadow of Thy most great mercy.”</q>  <q class="baha">“Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá   <span class="ed_note">[O Thou the Glory of Glories]</span>!”</q> He wrote in a Tablet revealed   during the last week of His life, <q class="baha">“I have renounced the world   and the people thereof, and am heartbroken and sorely afflicted because   of the unfaithful.  In the cage of this world I flutter even as a   frightened bird, and yearn every day to take my flight unto Thy Kingdom.   Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!  Make me to drink of the cup of sacrifice, and   set me free.  Relieve me from these woes and trials, from these afflictions   and troubles.”</q>   </p><h3 class="subhead" data-title="Failure to Acknowledge Claims of the Faith"></h3>  <p id="31">   Dear friends!  Alas, a thousand times alas, that a Revelation so   incomparably great, so infinitely precious, so mightily potent, so manifestly   <span data-pg="16"></span>   innocent, should have received, at the hands of a generation so   blind and so perverse, so infamous a treatment!  <q class="baha">“O My servants!”</q>   Bahá’u’lláh Himself testifies, <q class="baha">“The one true God is My witness!  This   most great, this fathomless and surging ocean is near, astonishingly   near, unto you.  Behold it is closer to you than your life vein!  Swift as the   twinkling of an eye ye can, if ye but wish it, reach and partake of this   imperishable favor, this God-given grace, this incorruptible gift, this   most potent and unspeakably glorious bounty.”</q>   </p><p id="32">   After a revolution of well nigh one hundred years what is it that the   eye encounters as one surveys the international scene and looks back   upon the early beginnings of Bahá’í history?  A world convulsed by the   agonies of contending systems, races and nations, entangled in the mesh   of its accumulated falsities, receding farther and farther from Him Who   is the sole Author of its destinies, and sinking deeper and deeper into a   suicidal carnage which its neglect and persecution of Him Who is its   Redeemer have precipitated.  A Faith, still proscribed, yet bursting   through its chrysalis, emerging from the obscurity of a century-old   repression, face to face with the awful evidences of God’s wrathful   anger, and destined to arise above the ruins of a smitten civilization.  A   world spiritually destitute, morally bankrupt, politically disrupted, socially   convulsed, economically paralyzed, writhing, bleeding and   breaking up beneath the avenging rod of God.  A Faith Whose call   remained unanswered, Whose claims were rejected, Whose warnings   were brushed aside, Whose followers were mowed down, Whose aims   and purposes were maligned, Whose summons to the rulers of the earth   were ignored, Whose Herald drained the cup of martyrdom, over the   head of Whose Author swept a sea of unheard-of tribulations, and   Whose Exemplar sank beneath the weight of lifelong sorrows and dire   misfortunes.  A world that has lost its bearings, in which the bright flame   of religion is fast dying out, in which the forces of a blatant nationalism   and racialism have usurped the rights and prerogatives of God Himself,   in which a flagrant secularism — the direct offspring of irreligion — has   raised its triumphant head and is protruding its ugly features, in which   <span data-pg="17"></span>   the <q class="baha">“majesty of kingship”</q> has been disgraced, and they who wore its   emblems have, for the most part, been hurled from their thrones, in   which the once all-powerful ecclesiastical hierarchies of Islám, and to a   lesser extent those of Christianity, have been discredited, and in which   the virus of prejudice and corruption is eating into the vitals of an   already gravely disordered society.  A Faith Whose institutions — the   pattern and crowning glory of the age which is to come — have been   ignored and in some instances trampled upon and uprooted, Whose   unfolding system has been derided and partly suppressed and crippled,   Whose rising Order — the sole refuge of a civilization in the embrace of   doom — has been spurned and challenged, Whose Mother-Temple has   been seized and misappropriated, and Whose <q class="baha">“House”</q> — the <q class="baha">“cynosure   of an adoring world”</q> — has, through a gross miscarriage of justice, as   witnessed by the world’s highest tribunal, been delivered into the hands   of, and violated by, its implacable enemies.   </p><p id="33">   We are indeed living in an age which, if we would correctly appraise   it, should be regarded as one which is witnessing a dual phenomenon.   The first signalizes the death pangs of an order, effete and godless, that   has stubbornly refused, despite the signs and portents of a century-old   Revelation, to attune its processes to the precepts and ideals which that   Heaven-sent Faith proffered it.  The second proclaims the birth pangs of   an Order, divine and redemptive, that will inevitably supplant the   former, and within Whose administrative structure an embryonic   civilization, incomparable and world-embracing, is imperceptibly   maturing.  The one is being rolled up, and is crashing in oppression,   bloodshed, and ruin.  The other opens up vistas of a justice, a unity, a   peace, a culture, such as no age has ever seen.  The former has spent its   force, demonstrated its falsity and barrenness, lost irretrievably its   opportunity, and is hurrying to its doom.  The latter, virile and   unconquerable, is plucking asunder its chains, and is vindicating its title to   be the one refuge within which a sore-tried humanity, purged from its dross,   can attain its destiny.   </p><p id="34">   <q class="baha">“Soon,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh Himself has prophesied, <q class="baha">“will the present-day   order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in its stead.”</q>  And again:  <q class="baha">“By   Myself!  The day is approaching when We will have rolled up the world   and all that is therein, and spread out a new Order in its stead.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The   day is approaching when God will have raised up a people who will call to   <span data-pg="18"></span>   remembrance Our days, who will tell the tale of Our trials, who will   demand the restitution of Our rights, from them who, without a tittle of   evidence, have treated Us with manifest injustice.”</q>   </p><h3 class="subhead" data-title="Responsibility of Kings and Ecclesiastics"></h3>  <p id="35">   Dear friends!  For the trials which have afflicted the Faith of   Bahá’u’lláh a responsibility appalling and inescapable rests upon those into   whose hands the reins of civil and ecclesiastical authority were delivered.   The kings of the earth and the world’s religious leaders alike   must primarily bear the brunt of such an awful responsibility.  <q class="baha">“Everyone   well knoweth,”</q> Bahá’u’lláh Himself testifies, <q class="baha">“that all the kings have   turned aside from Him, and all the religions have opposed Him.”</q>  <q class="baha">“From   time immemorial,”</q> He declares, <q class="baha">“they who have been outwardly invested   with authority have debarred men from setting their faces towards God.   They have disliked that men should gather together around the Most   Great Ocean, inasmuch as they have regarded, and still regard, such a   gathering as the cause of, and the motive for, the disruption of their   sovereignty.”</q>  <q class="baha">“The kings,”</q> He moreover has written, <q class="baha">“have recognized   that it was not in their interest to acknowledge Me, as have likewise the   ministers and the divines, notwithstanding that My purpose hath been   most explicitly revealed in the Divine Books and Tablets, and the True   One hath loudly proclaimed that this Most Great Revelation hath   appeared for the betterment of the world and the exaltation of the   nations.”</q>  <q class="bab">“Gracious God!”</q> writes the Báb in the   <span class="doc">Dalá’il-i-Sab‘ih</span> (Seven   Proofs) with reference to the <q class="baha">“seven powerful sovereigns ruling the world”</q>   in His day, <q class="bab">“None of them hath been informed of His <span class="ed_note">[the Báb’s]</span>   Manifestation, and if informed, none hath believed in Him.  Who   knoweth, they may leave this world below full of desire, and without   having realized that the thing for which they were waiting had come to   pass.  This is what happened to the monarchs that held fast unto the   Gospel.  They awaited the coming of the Prophet of God <span class="ed_note">[Mu?ammad]</span>,   and when He did appear, they failed to recognize Him.  Behold how great   are the sums which these sovereigns expend without even the slightest   thought of appointing an official charged with the task of acquainting   them in their own realms with the Manifestation of God!  They would   thereby have fulfilled the purpose for which they have been created.   All their desires have been and are still fixed upon leaving behind them   traces of their names.”</q>  The Báb, moreover, in that same treatise, censuring   the failure of the Christian divines to acknowledge the truth of   Mu?ammad’s mission, makes this illuminating statement:  <q class="bab">“The blame   <span data-pg="19"></span>   falleth upon their doctors, for if these had believed, they would have been   followed by the mass of their countrymen.  Behold then, that which hath   come to pass!  The learned men of Christendom are held to be learned by   virtue of their safeguarding the teaching of Christ, and yet consider how   they themselves have been the cause of men’s failure to accept the Faith   and attain unto salvation!”</q>   </p><p id="36">   It should not be forgotten that it was the kings of the earth and the   world’s religious leaders who, above all other categories of men, were   made the direct recipients of the Message proclaimed by both the Báb   and Bahá’u’lláh.  It was they who were deliberately addressed in numerous   and historic Tablets, who were summoned to respond to the Call of   God, and to whom were directed, in clear and forcible language, the   appeals, the admonitions and warnings of His persecuted Messengers.  It   was they who, when the Faith was born, and later when its mission was   proclaimed, were still, for the most part, wielding unquestioned and   absolute civil and ecclesiastical authority over their subjects and followers.   It was they who, whether glorying in the pomp and pageantry of a   kingship as yet scarcely restricted by constitutional limitations, or   entrenched within the strongholds of a seemingly inviolable ecclesiastical   power, assumed ultimate responsibility for any wrongs inflicted by those   whose immediate destinies they controlled.  It would be no exaggeration   to say that in most of the countries of the European and Asiatic   continents absolutism, on the one hand, and complete subservience to   ecclesiastical hierarchies, on the other, were still the outstanding features   of the political and religious life of the masses.  These, dominated   and shackled, were robbed of the necessary freedom that would enable   them to either appraise the claims and merits of the Message proffered to   them, or to embrace unreservedly its truth.   </p><p id="37">   Small wonder, then, that the Author of the Bahá’í Faith, and to a   lesser degree its Herald, should have directed at the world’s supreme   rulers and religious leaders the full force of Their Messages, and made   them the recipients of some of Their most sublime Tablets, and invited   them, in a language at once clear and insistent, to heed Their call.   Small wonder that They should have taken the pains to unroll before   <span data-pg="20"></span>   their eyes the truths of Their respective Revelations, and should have   expatiated on Their woes and sufferings.  Small wonder that They   should have stressed the preciousness of the opportunities which it was   in the power of these rulers and leaders to seize, and should have warned   them in ominous tones of the grave responsibilities which the rejection   of God’s Message would entail, and should have predicted, when   rebuffed and refused, the dire consequences which such a rejection   involved.  Small wonder that He Who is the King of kings and Vicegerent   of God Himself should, when abandoned, contemned and persecuted,   have uttered this epigrammatic and momentous prophecy:   <q class="baha">“From two ranks amongst men power hath been seized:  kings and   ecclesiastics.”</q>   </p><p id="38">   As to the kings and emperors who not only symbolized in their   persons the majesty of earthly dominion but who, for the most part,   actually held unchallengeable sway over the multitudes of their subjects,   their relation to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh constitutes one of the   most illuminating episodes in the history of the Heroic and Formative   Ages of that Faith.  The Divine summons which embraced within its   scope so large a number of the crowned heads of both Europe and Asia;   the theme and language of the Messages that brought them into direct   contact with the Source of God’s Revelation; the nature of their reaction   to so stupendous an impact; and the consequences which ensued and   can still be witnessed today are the salient features of a subject upon   which I can but inadequately touch, and which will be fully and   befittingly treated by future Bahá’í historians.   </p><h3 class="subhead" data-title="Warnings to Kings and Religious Leaders"></h3>  <p id="39">   The Emperor of the French, the most powerful ruler of his day on the   European continent, Napoleon III; Pope Pius IX, the supreme head of   the highest church in Christendom, and wielder of the scepter of both   temporal and spiritual authority; the omnipotent Czar of the vast Russian   Empire, Alexander II; the renowned Queen Victoria, whose   sovereignty extended over the greatest political combination the world   has witnessed; William I, the conqueror of Napoleon III, King of   Prussia and the newly acclaimed monarch of a unified Germany;   Francis Joseph, the autocratic king-emperor of the Austro-Hungarian   monarchy, the heir of the far-famed Holy Roman Empire; the tyrannical   ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz, the embodiment of the concentrated power vested in   the Sultanate and the Caliphate; the notorious Ná?iri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh, the   despotic ruler of Persia and the mightiest potentate of <u>Sh</u>í‘ih Islám — in a   <span data-pg="21"></span>   word, most of the preeminent embodiments of power and of sovereignty   in His day became, one by one, the object of Bahá’u’lláh’s special   attention, and were made to sustain, in varying degrees, the weight of   the force communicated by His appeals and warnings.   </p><p id="40">   It should be borne in mind, however, that Bahá’u’lláh has not restricted   the delivery of His Message to a few individual sovereigns, however   potent the scepters they severally wielded, and however vast the   dominions which they ruled.  All the kings of the earth have been   collectively addressed by His Pen, appealed to, and warned, at a time   when the star of His Revelation was mounting its zenith, and whilst He   lay a prisoner in the hands, and in the vicinity of the court, of His royal   enemy.  In a memorable Tablet, designated as the <span class="doc">Súriy-i-Mulúk</span> (Súrih   of Kings) in which the Sul?án himself and his ministers, and the kings of   Christendom, and the French and Persian Ambassadors accredited to   the Sublime Porte, and the Muslim ecclesiastical leaders in Constantinople,   and its wise men and its inhabitants, and the people of Persia,   and the philosophers of the world have been specifically addressed and   admonished, He thus directs His words to the entire company of the   monarchs of East and West:   </p><p id="41">     <q class="baha">“O kings of the earth!  Give ear unto the Voice of God, calling from this   sublime, this fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill,   upon the holy Plain, intoning the words:  ‘There is none other God but   He, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.’...  Fear God, O concourse   of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most   sublime grace.  Fling away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold   on the Handle of God, the Exalted, the Great.  Set your hearts towards   the Face of God, and abandon that which your desires have bidden you to   follow, and be not of those who perish.  Relate unto them, O servant, the   story of ‘Alí <span class="ed_note">[the Báb]</span>, when He came unto them with truth, bearing His   glorious and weighty Book, and holding in His hands a testimony and   proof from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him.  Ye, however, O   kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to be   guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a   resplendent Heaven.  Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would   <span data-pg="22"></span>   have been better for you than all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but   perceive it.  Ye remained careless until the divines of Persia — those cruel   ones — pronounced judgment against Him, and unjustly slew Him.  His   spirit ascended unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and the   angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason of this cruelty.  Beware   that ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime.   Return, then, unto God, your Maker, and be not of the heedless....  My   face hath come forth from the veils, and shed its radiance upon all that is   in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards Him, notwithstanding   that ye were created for Him, O concourse of kings!  Follow,   therefore, that which I speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your   hearts, and be not of such as have turned aside.  For your glory consisteth   not in your sovereignty, but rather in your nearness unto God and your   observance of His command as sent down in His holy and preserved   Tablets.  Should any one of you rule over the whole earth, and over all   that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its   plains, and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit him   not, could ye but know it....  Arise, then, and make steadfast your feet,   and make ye amends for that which hath escaped you, and set then   yourselves towards His holy Court, on the shore of His mighty Ocean, so   that the pearls of knowledge and wisdom, which God hath stored up   within the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you....   Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts, the   breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be   quickened....”</q>   </p><p id="42">    <q class="baha">“Lay not aside the fear of God, O kings of the earth,”</q> He, in that same   Tablet has revealed, <q class="baha">“and beware that ye transgress not the bounds   which the Almighty hath fixed.  Observe the injunctions laid upon you in   His Book, and take good heed not to overstep their limits.  Be vigilant,   that ye may not do injustice to anyone, be it to the extent of a grain of   mustard seed.  Tread ye the path of justice, for this, verily, is the straight   path.  Compose your differences, and reduce your armaments, that the   burden of your expenditures may be lightened, and that your minds and   hearts may be tranquilized.  Heal the dissensions that divide you, and ye   will no longer be in need of any armaments except what the protection of   your cities and territories demandeth.  Fear ye God, and take heed not to   outstrip the bounds of moderation, and be numbered among the extravagant.   We have learned that you are increasing your outlay every   <span data-pg="23"></span>   year, and are laying the burden thereof on your subjects.  This, verily, is   more than they can bear, and is a grievous injustice.  Decide justly   between men, and be ye the emblems of justice amongst them.  This, if ye   judge fairly, is the thing that behooveth you, and beseemeth your station.”</q></div>',
